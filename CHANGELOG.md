# Changelog

## 0.0.1

First release.

- Live preview that re-typesets the edited paragraph through rtex's fast path and installs background layouts as they arrive.
- Native display-list renderer for OpenType/TrueType fonts (glyph indices) and Type1/TFM fonts (through `pdftex.map`), with colors, rules, images and graphicx transforms. Pages it cannot draw exactly fall back to the background PDF, rendered by pdf.js.
- Two-way navigation: the preview follows the cursor, and a double-click in the preview jumps to the source.
- LaTeX errors and warnings in the Problems panel; a status pill and status bar entry that explain what the engine is doing.
- Export PDF, recompile, restart and stop commands; automatic main-file detection.
- Guided setup: walkthrough, **Check Setup**, one-click **Install rtex** (build from source) and an optional minimal TeX Live install.
- A first compile that fails or takes long explains itself (with the LaTeX log one click away) instead of waiting silently.
- Projects with subfolders work: rtex (≤ 0.0.2) does not create folders when it copies the project for a compile ("snapshot: No such file or directory"), so the extension creates them first.
